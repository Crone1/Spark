This repository contains the college work I did during the module 'Data Analysis at Speed and Scale' using the big data tool - Spark.

In this work, I used the MovieLens datast to build a recommender system for movies and users in this data.

A description of this data can be seen at http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html

I had already used this dataset for analysis in PIG, see https://github.com/Crone1/Pig, so this data had already been cleaned and uploaded to the HDFS cluster. This cleaning involved seperation of columns and joining of the data into one table.

This work was done using the Google Cloud Platform and a jupyter notebook web interfact for the hosted cluster.
